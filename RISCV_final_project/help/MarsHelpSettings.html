<h3>MARS - RISCV Assembly and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 1.0</h4>
<h4>September 2019</h4>
<h4>Configuration Settings</h4>
</center>

The Editor and Exception Handler items launch a dialog but the rest are each
controlled by a checkbox for selecting or deselecting it (checked means true, unchecked means false).  Settings and their default
values are:
   <ol>
   <li><b>Display the Labels window in the Execute tab.</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.  If selected, the Labels window,
       which shows the name and associated address for each label defined in the program, will be
       displayed to the right of the Text Segment.</li>
   <li><b>Provide program arguments to the RISCV program.</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.
       If selected, a text field will appear at the top of the Text Segment Display.  Any argument values in this
       text field at the time of program execution will be stored in RISCV memory prior to execution.  The argument
       count (argc) will be placed in register a0, and the address of an array of null-terminated strings containing
       the arguments (argv) will be placed in register a1.  These values are also available on the runtime stack (sp).
   <li><b>Popup Dialog for input syscalls (5,6,7,8,12).</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.  If selected, runtime console
input will be entered using popup dialogs.  Otherwise, input is entered
directly into the Run I/O tab at the bottom of the screen.</li>   
<li><b>Display memory addresses in hexadecimal.</b>  Default value is <b>true</b>.  If deselected, addresses will be displayed in decimal.
       This setting can also be toggled in a checkbox on the lower border of the Data Segment Window.</li>
   <li><b>Display memory and register contents in hexadecimal.</b>  Default value is <b>true</b>.  If deselected, vlaues will be displayed in decimal.
       This setting can also be toggled in a checkbox on the lower border of the Data Segment Window.</li>
   <li><b>Assemble a file automatically as soon as it is opened,</b> and initialize the File Open dialog with the most-recently opened file.  
       Default value is <b>false</b>.  This is convenient if you use an external editor for composing your programs.</li>
   <li><b>Assemble applies to all files in directory.</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.
       If selected, the file currently open in the
       editor will become the "main" program in a multi-file assemble-and-link operation involving all
       assembly files (*.asm; *.s) in its directory.  If successful, execution will begin with the currently open file. </li>
   <li><b>Assembler warnings are considered errors.</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.
       If selected, the assemble operation will fail if any warnings are produced.  At this time, all assembler warnings
       relate to unrecognized or ignored directives.  MARS may be able to assemble code produced by compilers for other MIPS
       assemblers if this setting is deselected.
   <li><b>Initialize Program Counter to global 'main' if defined.</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.
       If selected, the Program Counter will be initialized to the address of the text segment statement with the global label 'main' if it
       exists.  If it does not exist or if the setting is not selected, the Program Counter will be initialized to the default text segment
       starting address.
   <li><b>Permit programs to use extended (pseudo) instructions and formats.</b>  Default value is <b>true</b>.  This includes all memory addressing
       modes other than the RISCV native mode (16 bit constant offset added to register content).</li>
   <li><b>Assemble and execute programs using delayed branching.</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.  MIPS processors use delayed branches
       as part of the pipelined design, but it can be confusing to programmers.  With delayed branching, the instruction 
       following a branch or jump instruction <i>will always be executed</i> even if the branch condition is true!  Assemblers 
       and, failing that, programmers, often deal with this by following branches and jumps with a "<tt>nop</tt>" instruction.  The MARS
       assembler does <i>not</i> insert a <tt>nop</tt>. The relative branching
		 offset is always calculated as if delayed branching is enabled even when it is not.  The runtime simulation adjusts accordingly.</li>
   <li><b>Self-modifying code.</b>  Default value is <b>false</b>.
       If selected, a running MIPS program can write to a user text segment address and can branch/jump to a user data segment address.
	   These capabilities permit a program to dynamically generate and/or modify its binary code.  Also permits interactive modification of
	   text segment contents through either the Data Segment or Text Segment windows.
   <li><b>The Editor dialog.</b>  Use it to view and modify editor font settings.  New with Release 3.3.</li>
   <li><b>The Highlighting dialog.</b>  Use it to modify color and font settings for the highlighting of table items in the 
       Text Segment window, Data Segment window, Registers window, CSRs window and FPRegisters window.
       Highlighting occurs during timed, stepped, and backstepped simulation.  Color and font for normal (non-highlighted)
		 display can also be set separately for even-numbered and odd-numbered display rows but not individually by windows.
       </li>
   <li><b>The Exception Handler dialog.</b>  It has the setting: Include this
exception handler in all assemble operations.  Default value is <b>false</b>.  If selected, a button to browse to the desired
       file is enabled</li>
	<li><b>The Memory Configuration dialog.</b>  Use it to select from among available RISCV address space configurations.
	Some of the default configuration is derived from SPIM;
   </ol>

Settings are retained from one interactive session to the next.  Settings are stored in a system-dependent
way as specified by <tt>java.util.prefs.Preferences</tt>.  Windows systems use the Registry.
These settings are independent of command options given when using MARS from a command line;
neither affects the other.  We anticipate future releases will include additional settings and preferences.
