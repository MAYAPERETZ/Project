<h3>MARS - RISCV Assembly and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 1.0</h4>
<h4>September 2019</h4>

<h4>Operating Requirements</h4>
</center>
<p>MARS is written in Java and 
requires release 9 or later of the J2SE Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to work.
The graphical IDE is implemented using Swing. It has been 
tested only in Windows 10.

<h4>Some MARS Assembler and Simulator Limitations</h4>
</center>

Releases 1.0 assemble and simulate nearly all the RISCV32 and RISCV64 instructions documented in the
textbook <i>The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas</i> by David Patterson and Andrew Waterman
, 2017.
 
<p>Limitations of MARS as of Release 1.0 include:
<ul>
<li>The limitation of the RISCV version probably includes all MIPS version latest version limitations.</li>
For further details about MIPS latest version limitation, see the relevant page in:
<tt><b>http://www.cs.missouristate.edu/MARS/</b></tt>.

<li><em>TODO:</em>The CSRs window implementation remained almost untouched. This means that the current
                  implementation doesn't fit the RISCV architecture. This window was not removed in
                  order to future integration into RISCV architecture</li>

<li><em>TODO:</em>The current implementation was tested a lot, but yet not completely.
                  There may be some instruction which will have bugs</li>

<li><em>TODO:</em>The macros and the dump files were not modified according to the RISCV architecture.
                  The implementation of MIPS remained as is and there its behavior in the new
                  RISCV version is unexpected</li>

<li><em>Bug:</em>The FCSR is missing the inexact flag. This is because the implementation of it
                using Java's floating point types is not possible, since Java's floating-point
                numbers are not perfectly accurate</li>
