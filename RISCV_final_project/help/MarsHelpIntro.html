<h3>MARS - Mips Assembly and Runtime Simulator</h3>
<h4>Release 1.0</h4>
<h4>September 2019</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
</center>

MARS, the <b>R</b>ISCV <b>A</b>ssembly and <b>R</b>untime <b>S</b>imulator,
will assemble and simulate the execution of RISCV assembly language programs.
Currently, and unlike MIPS' MARS (which can also be used by the command line) it can only be used through its
integrated development environment (IDE).  MARS is written in Java and 
requires Release 9.0 of the J2SE Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to work.
It is distributed as an executable JAR file.

<p>This version of MARS is an adjustment of the MIPS's version to the RISCV architecture.
    As of the first release, MARS assembles and simulates most of the RISCV basic instruction,
    and the infrastructure for implementing new instructions was set.
    Yet, there is a lot to do to make it as complete as MIPS.
<p>
My guiding reference in implementing the instruction set has been
<i>The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas, First Edition</i> by David Patterson and Andrew Waterman,  2017.
It summarizes the RISCV-32/64 instruction set and pseudo-instructions , with details
provided in the text and in Appendix A.
It also implements all the system services (ecalls) and assembler directives as im MIPS version.

Another guiding reference has been
<i>The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual</i> Edited by Andrew Waterman1, Krste AsanoviÂ´c, 2017.
It specifies the implementation of the RISCV-32/64 instruction set in more details.

<p>The MARS IDE provides program editing and assembling but its real
strength is its support for interactive debugging.  The programmer can easily set and 
remove execution breakpoints or step through execution forward or backward (undo) while
viewing and directly editing register and memory contents.
